# JMart - Java-based Shopping Cart System

JMart is a console-based Java application simulating an online shopping platform. It offers users the ability to create accounts, log in, browse various product categories, manage a shopping cart, and proceed with multiple payment options. Key features include:

User Registration & Login: Users can create accounts with details like username, contact number, and password, and log in with these credentials.
Product Categories: Browse through Electronics, Clothing, and Footwear sections, each offering a variety of items with associated prices.
Shopping Cart Management: Add products to the cart, view the total bill, and remove items if necessary.
Payment Options: Choose from Credit/Debit cards, Net Banking, UPI, or Cash on Delivery.
Order Confirmation: After successful payment, the order is confirmed, and a summary of the total bill is displayed.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles in Java, user input handling, and the implementation of a basic e-commerce workflow.
